# kilianr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of kilianr is to reproduce Lutz Kilian’s results from

> Kilian, Lutz. 2009. “Not All Oil Price Shocks Are Alike: Disentangling
> Demand and Supply Shocks in the Crude Oil Market.” American Economic
> Review, 99 (3): 1053–69. DOI: 10.1257/aer.99.3.1053

<!-- ## Installation -->
<!-- You can install the development version of kilianr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->
<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("devtools") -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("richryan/kilianr") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ## Example -->
<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->
<!-- # ```{r example} -->
<!-- # library(kilianr) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- # ``` -->
<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
