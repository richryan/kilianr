## Introduction to computing a forecast error variance decomposition

A structural VAR model
allows us to answer how much of the forecast error variance
of $y_{t+h}$ at horizon $h=0,1,\dots,H$ is accounted for by each structural shock, $k=1,\dots,K$.
Sometimes the forecast error variance is referred to as the prediction mean-squared error.
In a stationary model,
as $h\rightarrow \infty$,
the limit of the forecast error variance decomposition is the variance decomposition of $y_t$.
