# kilianr

The goal of kilianr is to reproduce Lutz Kilian's results from

> Kilian, Lutz. 2009. "Not All Oil Price Shocks Are Alike: Disentangling Demand and Supply Shocks in the Crude Oil Market." American Economic Review, 99 (3): 1053â€“69.  DOI: 10.1257/aer.99.3.1053

Kilian's insights about the identification of oil shocks---and associated tools---are
then used to investigate how oil shocks affect Kern County, California.
In other words,
the goal is not creating an R package, per se;
rather,
the goal is using Kilian's tools.
This goal has dictated how the package is constructed.
More packages are imported and suggested than what are strictly necessary
to reproduce Kilian's results.

As a waypoint, 
I am attempting to publish a description of the package in [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/).
The draft is included in `joss/paper.md`.
To help cite work in the paper, I installed the RStudio Addin [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr),
which makes accessing entries in a .bib file easier.
And the RStudio Addin [wordcountaddin](https://github.com/benmarwick/wordcountaddin),
which provides a function that counts the number of words in a highlighted region.

**NOTE: This package uses the package `seasonal`, 
which is large.

## Notes on formatting documentation using `roxygen2`

For formatting documentation, I used
https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/formatting.html

The link includes how to make a table.

<!-- ## Installation -->

<!-- You can install the development version of kilianr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("devtools") -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("richryan/kilianr") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- # ```{r example} -->
<!-- # library(kilianr) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- # ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
