# kilianr

A system of tools for working with time-series data,
influenced by the book *Structural Vector Autoregressive Analysis*
by Lutz Kilian and Helmut L&uuml;tkepohl.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the development version of kilianr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("devtools") -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("richryan/kilianr") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Introduction to the package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The kilianr package provides a system of tools for working with time-series data,
influenced by the book *Structural Vector Autoregressive Analysis*
by Lutz Kilian and Helmut L&uuml;tkepohl.
I recommend people purchase a copy of *Structural Vector Autoregressive Analysis* to use together with the kilianr package.

Functions for estimating vector autoregressive models are provided.
Given short-run identifying assumptions,
structural estimates can be computed using the Cholesky decomposition.

<!-- A primary goal of kilianr is providing tools  -->
<!-- that allow researchers to produce results like those found in Lutz Kilian's work on the global market for crude oil: -->

A good example of what is achievable using the tools provided by the kilianr package is Kilian's article

> Kilian, Lutz. 2009. "Not All Oil Price Shocks Are Alike: Disentangling Demand and Supply Shocks in the Crude Oil Market." American Economic Review, 99 (3): 1053â€“69.  DOI: 10.1257/aer.99.3.1053

The results of the article have been updated here: TKTK

<!-- Kilian's insights about the identification of oil shocks---and associated tools---are -->
<!-- then used to investigate how oil shocks affect Kern County, California. -->
<!-- In other words, -->
<!-- the goal is not creating an R package, per se; -->
<!-- rather, -->
<!-- the goal is using Kilian's tools. -->
<!-- This goal has dictated how the package is constructed. -->
<!-- More packages are imported and suggested than what are strictly necessary -->
<!-- to reproduce Kilian's results. -->

As a waypoint,
I am attempting to publish a description of the package in [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/).
The draft is included in `joss/paper.md`.

<!-- To help cite work in the paper, I installed the RStudio Addin [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr), -->
<!-- which makes accessing entries in a .bib file easier. -->
<!-- And the RStudio Addin [wordcountaddin](https://github.com/benmarwick/wordcountaddin), -->
<!-- which provides a function that counts the number of words in a highlighted region. -->

## Evolving philosophy that guides the package

The package is aimed at applied economists.

Which means that the package anticipates that the user will have have many R packages installed from the tidy ecosystem.
The package therefore *depends* on having functions available from these package.
This, for example, allows me to return matricies as tibbles,
which are easier to manipulate,
without having to preface chains of tidy statements with dplyr:: or tidyr::.

The choice is rather heavy-handed, admittedly.
<!-- Alternative  -->

<!-- For example, -->
<!-- I maintain that many users will have packages like dplyr and ggplot2 installed on their systems, because -->
<!-- they prefer to use the tidy ecosystem for working with data. -->
<!-- In addition, -->
<!-- I make use of the function `seas()` from the seasonal package. -->
<!-- While this is a heavy package, -->
<!-- seasonal adjustment is a common task. -->

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- # ```{r example} -->
<!-- # library(kilianr) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- # ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
